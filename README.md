# My Project

## Introduction
This project was used to show my enjoyment of music. Here, I made a website that allows users to add and delete songs from a playlist.
The songs that they add and delete are saved within my own built-in API called songs. In order to add a song, users can embed a video from YouTube or any other video playing service to the website and listen to some of their favorite songs. The playlist comes with five of its own songs by default, and users can voice their opinions on it, by letting the site know if they like the song, if they think it is ok, or if it completely garbage. This site is free and easy to use and will sport massive improvemnts along the way.
