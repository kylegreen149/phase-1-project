        <h1>Play-Dis Playa</h1>
        <h2>A Playlist For Your Own Convenience</h2>
        <p><b>How This Works:</b> On this website you can make your own playlist by submitting a link from YouTube. 
            Fill out the form below to add a song, and make sure to include <b>ALL </b>of the songs basic details. When adding
            a song in the Link to Song input field, make sure to include this link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/ at the beginning 
            to ensure that the song is properly embedded onto this site. We have five pre-added songs for you that we hope you enjoy. 
            If you don't like it, don't be afraid to press the
            "This song is trash button" You are also free to add as many songs as you like.
            If you like a song, press the "This song is fiya button". 
            This will turn the songCard green, and when you come back later,
            you'll remember that you loved the song. 
            However, if you pressed the "This song is mid" button, the background of 
            the song card will be yellow, letting you know later on that you think the song is ok, but won't give it the same amount
            of listens as a song that you really enjoy.
